## 1. What is it?

This is a simple imageviewer app with which you can view images from your device and control the zoom and pan functions. It was build with React Native for iOS devices. An Android version is on the roadmap.

## 2. How to run?

1. If this is your first time running a react native app setup your local environment: https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment
2. `$ npm install`
3. `$ npx pod-install` or cd into the ios folder and run `$ pod install`
4. `$ npm run ios` or `$ npm run start` to start all available simulators (only iOS supported so far).
5. If configured correctly the app can be ran through XCode on your preferred simulator or real device.
